<h2><a id="about"></a>About Our Planetarium</h2>

<p>Built alongside the Physics and Astronomy building in 1994, the UW planetarium is a unique space for students to explore the night sky. The dome is 30 feet in diameter and originally included a Minolta MS-8 starball, a precisely constructed optical/mechanical system that projects an accurate view of the night sky as viewed from anywhere on Earth.&nbsp;In 2005, a&nbsp;$90,000 UW&nbsp;<a href="https://techfee.uw.edu">Student Technology</a> grant enabled the addition of advanced audio and video equipment.&nbsp;In 2009, a collaboration with Microsoft’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/">WorldWide Telescope</a> team transformed the planetarium into a fully digital dome with an 8-million-pixel display for an interactive experience (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0342">Rosenfield et al. 2010</a> for more information). In 2015 and 2020, additional grants — totaling nearly $120,000 — allowed for upgrades, including new projectors, computers, and software, ensuring the planetarium's relevance and capacity to serve the community.</p>

<p>As of 2022, the UW planetarium is under leadership of Program Director <a href="/people/anastasios-tzanidakis">Anastasios (Andy) Tzanidakis</a>, with oversight provided by <a href="/people/oliver-fraser">Oliver Fraser</a>. The planetarium is equipped with state-of-the-art projectors and immersive audio systems, providing guests with an exceptional astronomical experience. What sets the UW planetarium apart is its ability to showcase real data-driven astronomical images and simulations, offering dynamic and interactive shows that cater to individuals of all ages and varying levels of astronomical knowledge.</p>

<h2><a id="location"></a>Location</h2>

<p>The University of Washington Planetarium is located on the second floor of the Physics and Astronomy Auditorium (PAA). When you arrive at our building, you will find dedicated directions pointing to our planetarium.</p>

<p>To access the UW planetarium you can either take the spiral staircase located in PAA, or you can take the elevators located on the right side of the stairwell to the second floor.</p>

<h3>Building Attractions</h3>

<p>The Physics and Astronomy Auditorium where the planetarium is located, contains a 100-foot-long Foucault pendulum. A Foucault pendulum is a device used to measure the rotation of the Earth by observing a swinging pendulum that precesses relative to the Earth slowly over one day. The physics department has more details on the <a href="https://phys.washington.edu/pab-building-architecture">building's architecture</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parking Resources</h3>

<p>All personal vehicles must pay to park on campus. To find parking on campus first visit one of the parking Gatehouse locations, let them know your destination, and ask what the nearest available parking to the <strong>Physics and Astronomy Building</strong> is at that time of day. Note that some parking lots may be full later in the day, so we do not recommend a specific lot here.&nbsp;More information on parking on campus can be found on the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/facilities/transportation/park">Transportation Services website</a>.</p>

<h2>Visit Planning</h2>

<p>Before scheduling your planetarium show please be mindful of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our planetarium has a 40-person seating capacity</li>
	<li>Due to limited staff capacity, we offer a limited number of planetarium shows each year. Although we cannot guarantee availability on your requested date, we will do our best to accommodate your group</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility Resources</h3>

<p>If your group requires any accommodations for any special learning needs, an ASL translator or non-English language translator, please directly contact the Program Director, Andy Tzanidakis (<a href="mailto:atzanida@uw.edu">atzanida@uw.edu</a>).</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>In keeping with the University-wide Codes of Conduct, the UW Planetarium is dedicated to creating an inclusive and welcoming space for all visitors. We firmly emphasize the importance of respecting diversity and embracing people of all backgrounds, identities, and beliefs. Hate speech or discrimination based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, or any personal characteristics will not be tolerated. We believe in mutual respect and the value of diverse perspectives.

<p><em><strong>Do you offer shows on weekends?&nbsp;</strong></em>Unfortunately, we do not offer shows on weekends as campus buildings are locked on Saturdays and Sundays, making the planetarium inaccessible to volunteers and visitors.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the cost for a planetarium show?&nbsp;</em></strong>All shows at the planetarium are free! If you enjoy your group visit, or one of the public shows please consider <a href="#donations">donating</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>How long is a planetarium show?&nbsp;</strong></em>Shows are typically 45 minutes in length, but with time for questions at the end they may run closer to an hour.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the seating capacity in the planetarium?&nbsp;</em></strong>The planetarium can seat 40 people. Group reservations, including chaperones and students, are not to exceed this number as it is our fire code capacity. If you have a larger group, please consider scheduling two separate shows</p>

Please plan your campus visit accordingly.</p>

<h2><a id="group"></a>Group Visits</h2>

<p>Planetarium shows are given on a purely volunteer basis. We gladly serve UW groups, K-12 groups that are studying astronomy, and public groups (such as astronomy clubs or scouts). The planetarium is open to these groups on Fridays during the academic year with presentations starting between the hours of 10am and 1pm, on a first-requested, first-served basis. <strong>All dates and times available for the current quarter are listed in the drop down menu below</strong>. If your preferred date and time do not appear on the drop-down menu below, it is because that time slot is already booked, or unavailable. Please be aware that our shows are very popular and book up quickly. Please plan to book about 1-2 months ahead of your intended visit. Unfortunately, we do not offer any activities outside of the planetarium show itself. Shows have no fee but <a href="#donations">donations</a> towards the upkeep of our planetarium are gladly accepted.</p>

<p>Shows are generally about 45 minutes in length, and the planetarium can seat 40 people. If your group is larger than 40 people please make separate requests for shows. The planetarium is handicap-accessible, although it’s difficult for visually impaired students to receive the maximum impact since the simulation is extremely visual in nature.</p>
